## Jordan Bill Kuznia 

In June of 2013 I started working with mens style at the Men's Wearhouse in Bismarck, North Dakota while I was attending the University of Mary. While working there I began developing my knowledge on the basics of mens fashion and style. Over the next two years I would continue to learn and explore the topic, all the while enhancing my personal style and wardrobe. In March of 2015 I moved to Fargo, North Dakota and worked at a local family owned store called Straus Clothing, which opening initially in 1879\. While there I learned more about the foundations of style and a lot of the history and details of the mens clothing business from the Stern brothers who ran the store. I worked there until the owners retired and the store went out of business. Now I am taking all that I have learned and am working at Men's Wearhouse in Fargo, ND and am willing to work with you independently to create your ideal outfit or full wardrobe.
