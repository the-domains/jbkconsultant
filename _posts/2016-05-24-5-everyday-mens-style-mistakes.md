# 5 Everyday Men's Style Mistakes

> For a gentleman, style is one of his most important tools, and is a deeply personal aspect of who they are. While I do encourage you to stay true to your own style, there are certain things that you simply should not do. Your style tells people about you without you having to say a word, and if you aren't dressed the part it's going to come across that you don't know what you are doing. 

I'm going to share with you five (5) of the most common mistakes I see men making when I am out in public, and I hope that it will help you step up your own style game. 

## one. suit buttons

Buttoning both buttons of a suit. This is not how these coats are meant to be worn. On your standard two-button coat you should only ever button the top button. If you have a three-button coat you should button the middle button, and the top button as well, if you wish. The shape of a coat is designed to only have those buttons done. 

## two. belts & braces ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/02ad261d-997e-4dc2-982e-fbf940449ff5.jpg)

Wearing both a belt and braces (suspenders) at the same time. First of all, it's redundant since suspenders and belts do the same thing. Secondly, it should never be questioned and never done. End of story. 

## three. tucking it in ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/640c52af-6296-4163-b286-8c4a23f17ba5.jpg)

Always wear a belt or suspenders when tucking in your shirt. Ultimately your waistband will look sloppy without some sort of transition or support that these items bring. 

## four. belts & shoes ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3b3b5586-a98c-41af-b325-8b490bfa3e09.jpg)

Your belt should always match your shoes. It's far too often that I see people with a black belt and brown shoes. The only exception is with hard to match leathers, in which case you just try to coordinate appropriately. 

## five. collar stays ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/89a397c7-a948-4fb7-9bce-348f1a1ec4e0.jpg)

If your shirt does not have button down collars, make sure you have a collar stay in your collar. It's that little piece of metal or plastic that keep your collar stiff and stops it from flopping around or curling. It just looks sloppy if you don't have that in place, and if you're trying to dress for success you don't want to look sloppy. 

These are just a few items that I've seen, and I hope that you'll be mindful of what I've mentioned here. Your style should be ever evolving, but these are some staples for you to take with you.
