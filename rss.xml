            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>5 Everyday Men's Style Mistakes</h1><p>For a gentleman, style is one of his most important tools, and is a deeply personal aspect of who they are. While I do encourage you to stay true to your own style, there are certain things that you simply should not do. Your style tells people about you without you having to say a word, and if you aren’t dressed the part it’s going to come across that you don’t know what you are doing. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9de161df3ba4cc1ab446e2ebbf59d5fdde0dc0be.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>bio.</h1><h2>Jordan Bill Kuznia</h2><p>In June of 2013 I started working with mens style at the Men's Wearhouse in Bismarck, North Dakota while I was attending the University of Mary. While working there I began developing my knowledge on the basics of mens fashion and style. Over the next two years I would continue to learn and explore the topic, all the while enhancing my personal style and wardrobe. In March of 2015 I moved to Fargo, North Dakota and worked at a local family owned store called Straus Clothing, which opening initially in 1879. While there I learned more about the foundations of style and a lot of the history and details of the mens clothing business from the Stern brothers who ran the store. I worked there until the owners retired and the store went out of business. Now I am taking all that I have learned and am working at Men's Wearhouse in Fargo, ND and am willing to work with you independently to create your ideal outfit or full wardrobe.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c27b9e186e3450c35f383dab9c9b5fdca46dca7b.jpg"></article>]]></description>
